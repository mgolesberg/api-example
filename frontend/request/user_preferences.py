    This function creates a Streamlit form that allows users to manage their

    Parameters
    ----------
    preference_name : str
        The name of the preference category (e.g., "interests", "dislikes",
        "allergies"). Must be one of: "interests", "dislikes", "allergies".
    list_of_choices : list[str]
        List of suggested choices for the preference category.
        These will be displayed as checkboxes in the form.

    -----
    The function automatically handles:
    - Loading existing user preferences
    - Displaying checkboxes for suggested choices
    - Allowing custom input via text field
    - Adding new preferences via API calls
    - Removing deselected preferences via API calls

    The form expects the user object to have methods like:
    - get_interests(), add_interests(), delete_interests()
    - get_dislikes(), add_dislikes(), delete_dislikes()
    - get_allergies(), add_allergies(), delete_allergies()
